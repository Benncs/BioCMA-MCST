"""
Minimal working program to use BioMC API V0.5.

This program demonstrates a basic example of how to perform a simulation using BioMC from a Python program.
It focuses on:
- Creating a handle for shared execution (No MPI)
- Performing basic simulation settings and running it
- Loading and running a basic simulation

Note that the linked library is the shared one, this will not work linking the distributed one.

Usage:
    Run this script to perform a simulation using BioMC API V0.5.
